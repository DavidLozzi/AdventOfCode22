## Day 12

Was frustrating. Many people printed or just counted it manually. I started down that road, and decided that because it's a counting exercise, I would run someone elses code. I decided
to use [this person's code](https://github.com/mariom100o/Advent-of-Code-Solutions), big thanks to marium100o for sharing their code! It worked flawlessly.
